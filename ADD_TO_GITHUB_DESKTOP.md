# How to Add Repository to GitHub Desktop

## Step 1: Open GitHub Desktop

- Press **Windows key** (⊞)
- Type: `GitHub Desktop`
- Press Enter

---

## Step 2: Add Your Local Repository

If you don't see "N-SNA" in the repository list:

1. Click **File** → **Add Local Repository** (or press `Ctrl+O`)

2. In the dialog that opens:
   - Click **Choose...** button
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\nouf_\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\N-SNA`
   - Click **Select Folder** or **OK**

3. GitHub Desktop will detect it's a git repository and add it

## Step 3: Verify You See the Commits

After adding, you should see:

**At the bottom of GitHub Desktop:**
```
3 commits ahead of origin/main
```

**In the changes panel, you should see:**
- "Fix absolute paths for GitHub Pages compatibility"
- "Prepare app for GitHub Pages - move to docs folder"  
- "Update GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md..."

---

## Step 4: Push the Commits

1. Look at the **top toolbar**
2. Click **"Push origin"** button (may show "Push origin (3)")
3. Wait for it to complete

---

## Alternative: If GitHub Desktop Still Doesn't Show Commits

If after adding the repository you still don't see commits:

1. Click **Repository** → **Show in Explorer** (to verify you're in the right folder)
2. Click **Repository** → **Pull** (to sync)
3. Check the bottom status bar for "X commits ahead"
